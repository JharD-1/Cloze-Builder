## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla Javascript 


### What I learned
how you can use the add event listener function on events on page
and also the splice() and join() methods

```js
for(var i = 0; i < numberOfWordsToRemove; i++) {
        var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * words.length);
        words.splice(randomIndex, 1, "<span class='blank-line'>.....</span>");
    }
```

### Continued development

I'm still learning the basics of Javascript 

### Useful resources
